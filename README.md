## Development

You can open project at root `admin-boilerplate` or single package `packages/<package-name>`.

## Note for releasing

- [ ] You need to navigate to the master branch because we only make release on the newest of master branch.

You run the script [release.sh](./release.sh) for releasing new version.
You need to set `GL_TOKEN` so that the script can access the gitlab.
The script will do:

- [x] Choose version bumps
- [x] Generate change logs
- [x] Create commit and tags for the release
- [x] Push new release to the remote
- [x] Create relase on the git system (gitlab)

More detail [here](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/main/commands/version#lifecycle-scripts).

### Sample

```bash
export GL_TOKEN=<your gitlab token>
./release.sh
```

### Explain

The script does:

```bash
# this is require for create release on the gitlab
export GL_API_URL=https://git.baikal.io/api/v4
export GL_TOKEN=<your gitlab token>

lerna version
```

For the GL_TOKEN, you can follow [this document](https://git.baikal.io/help/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md#creating-a-personal-access-token) to genrate it.
